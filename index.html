            <p>
                Coordinate reference systems (CRSs) are a pain. Most geospatial professionals know enough to get
                by, but struggle when there is a problem. GIS textbooks that explain CRSs by building up from first
                principles aren't helpful without knowing what the problem is.

                This is a <span class="bold">problem-based guide</span class="bold"> of common CRS issues, their root
                causes, and possible solutions.

                <p>
                    <span class="part2"><span class="bold">Coordinates</span>: numbers describing the data
                        point's position in space.</span>

                </p>
            </div>
            <p>For example:</p>

            <h2><a href="#null-island">I hate coordinate systems! My geospatial dataset is off the coast of Africa!</a>

                    Your dataset probably has some junk <span class="part2">coordinates</span>.
                </span>
                Many data formats store "null" as zeroes. If your software is assuming a <span class="part3">geographic
                    coordinate system</span> (GCS), then the point with <span class="part2">coordinates</span> (0, 0) is
                where the equator crosses the prime meridian off the
                coast of Africa in the Gulf of Guinea, humorously known as <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Island">Null Island</a>. This can sometimes happen when
                importing from Excel and empty rows are not trimmed off.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">Solution:</span> Remove the data points from your dataset whose <span
                    class="part2">coordinates</span> are null.

                This can happen if the <span class="part3">coordinate system</span> is missing altogether, in which case
                GIS software often assumes a GCS without telling you. A GCS only ranges from -180° west to +180° east in
                the horizontal axis and -90° south to +90 north in the vertical axis. If the <span
                    class="part2">coordinates</span> in your dataset are out of this range then your data will look like
                it's off of the Earth.

                A data point's <span class="part1">attributes</span> gives context to where on the Earth it is located.
                Most GIS software will display the minimum and maximum <span class="part2">coordinates</span> in the
                layer's properties as "extent" or "bounding box". From these, you can do some

                    to
                    90, then you probably want a longitude,latitude geographic <span class="part3">coordinate

                    like WGS84.

                    redefining to one of the neighboring zones. For example, if UTM Zone 19N is wrong, try UTM Zone 18N.

                <li>
                    If the <span class="part1">attributes</span> suggest the dataset is in the USA, try

                    a data point's <span class="part2">coordinates</span> by 3.28084 to convert feet to meters/meters to

                    If the minimum X/Y <span class="part2">coordinates</span> are both zero and the maxmimum X/Y <span
                        class="part2">coordinates</span> are both positive then the dataset may have been exported from
                    non-geospatial software like Photoshop or Illustrator or Inkscape. This is especially likely if the
                    data
                    is flipped vertically since that software typically has the Y-axis increasing going down. You will
                    need
                    to manually georeference the dataset to use it.

                equidistant. Depending on the amount of distortion associated with the projection, this can lead to
                (wildly) incorrect measurements without you knowing. In the common case of the Mercator projection,

                    for a region of the Earth. Examples include UTM, Gauss-Kruger, State Plane, and equidistant

                Sea level follows the geoid, a surface which is lumpy because of minute regional variations in gravity.
                GNSS systems like GPS do not measure the height above the geoid but rather the idealized mathematical
                representation called the ellipsoid. Some GPS devices have a database that automatically converts
                ellipsoidal height to sea level (aka orthometric height), but many do not.

            <p>
